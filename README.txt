Building Example Programs
=========================

The following tools are required to build the example programs:
- cmake
- git
If they are not yet installed on your system, install them, and make sure the path to the executables is in the PATH variable.

We assume the following C++ compiler is installed, depending on your operating system:
- Linux: gcc or clang
- Windows: visual studio 2022
- MacOS/iOS: Xcode
- Android: android ndk

Run the script

    ./build-all.sh

or, on windows,

    build.bat

to fetch and build all required libraries (SDL3, OpenCV, boost, Eigen, glatter) that are not already installed on the system. Building the libraries may take a while. Then, the example programs are built.

If you prefer not to build external libraries, you can start cmake by hand:

    cmake -B build src
    cmake --build build

In this case, only those examples are build, for which all required libraries are found.


Cross-Compiling for iOS
-----------------------
To build for iOS, you also need to specify your developer team id (see https://developer.apple.com/help/account/manage-your-team/locate-your-team-id), and to pass some additional arguments. The following command will build for minimum iOS version 17.

    ./build-all.sh -G Xcode -DCMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME=iOS -DCMAKE_XCODE_ATTRIBUTE_IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=17 -DAPPLE_DEVELOPER_TEAM=<your_developer_team_id>

Then, open build/goopax_examples.xcodeproj and install the programs manually.


Cross-Compiling for iOS Simulator
---------------------------------
To build for the iOS simulator, follow the steps for iOS, but with the additional -DCMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT=iphonesimulator option.


Cross-Compiling for Android
---------------------------
Set the ANDROID_NDK_ROOT environment variable to the location of the Android NDK.

Then run something like this:

    ./build-all.sh -DCMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME=Android -DCMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION=25 -DCMAKE_ANDROID_ARCH_ABI=arm64-v8a -DCMAKE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE=1

For the graphical example programs, shared libraries are created. They need to be further incorporated into an android app.
